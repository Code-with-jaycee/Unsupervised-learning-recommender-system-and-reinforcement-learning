# Clustering. (unsupervised)
Clustering is a technique in machine learning and data analysis that involves together similar data points into clusters. 

# Applications.
- Grouping similar news
- Market segmentation
- DNA analysis
- Astronomical data analysis

# K-mean intuations
- This is a clustering algorithm in machine learning that is used to partition a set of data points into K clusters. 
- The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the sum of squared distance between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster.
